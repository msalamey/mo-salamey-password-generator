# mo-salamey-password-generator

In this assignment I created a website hat an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected using JavaScript. 

Actions taken:
Utilized JavaScript to create variables and arrays for those variables. The data contained in the variables were alpha, numeric and special characters. 
The function was provided to write the password. 
Utilized "if/else" in order to capture the selected criteria when generating a password. 
Utilized the "for" loop in order and random math function in order ot create a password with the selected critera.
Utilized the "return" to get the actual password to generate on the webstie.
